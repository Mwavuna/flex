      <H1>In life:</H1>
      Greatmen strive and greatmen fall</p>
      Kingdoms rise and Kingdoms fall</p>
      legends rise and legends fall </P>
      Its bright on one hemisphere and dark on the other </P>
      Its raining,but there still will come floods with raining,</p>
      It stops raining,</p>
      The sun is out,but still,drought will come with the same sun </p>
      We are happy in the morning omly to sleep sad </P>
      Smiles today,tommorow are frowns </P>
      Alies become foes and the later become Alies </P>
      People fight and people reconcile,others dont</P>
      Some people are alive,others are only breathing</p>
